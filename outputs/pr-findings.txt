❗ **Detected the use of eval(). eval() can be dangerous if used to evaluate dynamic content. If this content can be input from outside the program, this may be a code injection vulnerability. Ensure evaluated content is not definable by external sources.** in `../../DVWA/vulnerabilities/javascript/source/high.js:1`
  - 💡 *Refactor the code to remove the use of `eval()` for evaluating dynamic content. Instead, use safer alternatives for handling the intended functionality without the risk of code injection vulnerabilities.  10. Replace the `RegExp()` constructor with hardcoded regular expressions, or validate user input strictly before passing it to the regular expression engine. Consider using a library specifically designed to check for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities, such as "recheck", to ensure the regex patterns are safe for use.*
❗ **RegExp() called with a `f` function argument, this might allow an attacker to cause a Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) within your application as RegExP blocks the main thread. For this reason, it is recommended to use hardcoded regexes instead. If your regex is run on user-controlled input, consider performing input validation or use a regex checking/sanitization library such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/recheck to verify that the regex does not appear vulnerable to ReDoS.** in `../../DVWA/vulnerabilities/javascript/source/high.js:1`
