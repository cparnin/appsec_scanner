This module is a placeholder for future SCA integration (e.g., Trivy, Syft).
It is designed to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (SCA), but is not yet implemented.

TODO (Guild):
- Integrate Trivy or Syft for dependency scanning
- Normalize output to standard finding format
- Add tests and CLI integration
